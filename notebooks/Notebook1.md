# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

	The critique on the project proposal gave me a lot of good advice on what to watch out for when moving forward with the project. I don't think there are any specific changes to be made so early on, but moving forward with a focused core that works simply and easily is important to keep in mind.

## Description

I had slated this week for design work, but that ended up getting signifiantly hampered by being unsure where to begin. I have a description for how I want the syntax to look out, and it's defined in a way where it'll be easy to proceed one step at a time with the implementation.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

	The biggest issue for the project is probably still researching libraries to make outputting much simpler.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

	One good question for the critique partners at this point is probably to critique the proposed specifics of the language- whether there's unintuitive or unnecessary notation, or anything like that.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**

	This week did not go as well as I initially hoped it would. I had hoped in the contract that I'd be going forward with a rock solid design for the project, but as it is, there's still a lot of uncertainties that will have to take until I'm further into the project to decide.
