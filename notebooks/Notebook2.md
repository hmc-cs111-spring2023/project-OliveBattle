# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique
	Through critiquing others' work, I got a bit more insight into designing the project, and that some decisions that seem "natural" to a programmer can end up seeing unfammiliar to those in the domain. Requiring extensive use of parentheses- especially if they're nested- can end up making a language seem a lot less intitutive, for example.

## Description

At this point in the project, I decided on the language I'm going to use (Java). I went with this because from what I found, it has the widest array of libraries that would be useful for the final outfit to pdf files. I also focused on designing some of the basic structures of the backend. I'm still going ahead with the assumption that every part boils down to a note, and that the final piece is just one long array of notes.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**
	The biggest issue is still what final way to output the file. I could use musicxml to do so, but that has a lot of syntax that would make the final project need a lot of implementation heavy work, and less design.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**
	I'm not really sure what to ask of my critique partners. Maybe more feedback on the example program, and whether that design seems to "make sense"?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**
	I spent a few hours working on the project, but most of that time was spent researching libraries to use for the output, so relatively little time was spent with the core of the backend.

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**
	I'm still aways behind of where I wanted to be in the project. I have a n idea for the backend, but don't yet have the necessary research into existing libraries needed to design the output.
